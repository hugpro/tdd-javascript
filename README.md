# TDD in Javascript
This is a very simple boilerplate to try out TDD in Javascript. It uses [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) as the package manager and build tool, [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as the testing and assertion library, and just plain Javascript.

## Getting started
1. Install dependencies by doing an `npm install` in your directory. This will add Jest.
2. To run tests, use `npm test`.
3. Make iterative changes to the `add.test.js` file, by adding new test scenarios. Once you have a failing test, update `add.js` to support the new test scenarios. Refactor if needed. Repeat until you have implemented all the requirements.
